Mobile hand gesture recognition for phones using accelerometer data and HMM.

### Overview
This repository is part of my final year project at Imperial College London.
It has 3 major parts:

- `/acceldatacollect`: Mobile web application that can record and recognize acceleration data from 
most modern smartphones. The live version can be found at http://acceldatacollect.appspot.com.
More detais in `/acceldatacollect/Readme.md`

- `/matlab_evaluation`: Uses Hidden Markov Models and the datasets in `dataset` to create models that 
recognize hand gestures. More detais in `/matlab_evaluation/Readme.md`.

- `hardware_prototypes`: Plans and schematics of mobile indication unit for cyclists that was 
developed as part of the project. The devie can be worn by a cylist at night and he lifts the arm
it starts flashing. 



TODO: Add link to my final report....
